inspired by /u/drysle method 

So I solved this problem with no code.
With the limitations of the elevator, the best strategy for moving objects (microchips or generators) is to move 2 objects up a floor, then 1 object down a floor. That means moving 10 objects up one floor requires 17 moves. (2 moves per object, minus 3 because the last two objects get moved just once, and you don't need to return to the lower floor.)
My input started with two objects on the second floor, so subtract 4 moves for the work already done. 17 + 17 + 17 - 4 = 47, which was the right answer for part 1. Add 24 moves for the 4 additional objects in part 2.

e.g. part 2

14 objects * 2 moves = 28 moves
28 moves - 3 moves saved when moving last 3 items = 25 moves
25 moves * 3 floors = 75 moves
75 moves - 4 moves saved because 2 items are on the second floor already = 71 moves
